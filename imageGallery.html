    <h2><em><center>The Bluebell</center></em></h2>
    <img src="bluebell.jpg" alt="bluebell" class="center" width="200px">
    <p><center>Bluebells grow well in either sun or partial shade, but do better out of direct,
      strong sunlight. They prefer a moist, but well-drained soil that doesn’t
      dry out in summer.</center></p>

    <h3><em><center>The Jasmine</center></em></h3>
    <img src="jasmine.jpg" alt="jasmine" class="center" width="200px">
    <p><center>Indoors, jasmines prefer a brightly lit position, preferably a south-facing or
      west-facing aspect, but with some protection from strong, burning sunlight in
      summer. They can be moved outside to a warm, sunny patio in summer, but make
      sure you bring them back indoors before the weather turns cold and frosty in autumn.
      They need a minimum temperature of 13-15°C.</center></p>

  <div>
    <h4><em><center>The Lavender</center></em></h4>
    <img src="lavender.jpg" alt="lavender" class="center" width="200px">
    <p><center>Easy to grow shrub that flowers in late spring and summer. Is best planted in
      spring, in free-draining soil and thrives in full sun and is drought tolerant.</center></p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h5><em><center>The Lilies</center></em></h5>
    <img src="lilly.jpg" alt="lilly" class="center" width="200px">
    <p><center>Grown from bulbs, lilies are perennial flowers that will return year after year and
      require minimal care, provided that you plant them in the right place. Plant in the fall,
      a few weeks before the winter brings freezing temperatures, but ensure they are planted where
      there is lots of available sunlight, betweem 6-8hrs per day.</center></p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h6><em><center>The Marigold</center></em></h6>
    <img src="marigold.jpg" alt="marigold" class="center" width="200px">
    <p><center>Marigolds need a sunny position, as they flower poorly in shade. They need a
      well-drained soil that holds moisture during their summer flowering period.</center></p>
