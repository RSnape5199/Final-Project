  <h2><em>The Bluebell</em></h2>
  <img src="bluebell.jpg" width="200px">
  <p>Bluebells grow well in either sun or partial shade, but do better out of direct,
    strong sunlight. They prefer a moist, but well-drained soil that doesn’t
    dry out in summer.</p>
</div>

  <h3><em>The Jasmine</em></h3>
  <img src="jasmine.jpg" width="200px">
  <p>Indoors, jasmines prefer a brightly lit position, preferably a south-facing or
    west-facing aspect, but with some protection from strong, burning sunlight in
    summer. They can be moved outside to a warm, sunny patio in summer, but make
    sure you bring them back indoors before the weather turns cold and frosty in autumn.
    They need a minimum temperature of 13-15°C.</p>

  <h4><em>The Lavender</em></h4>
  <img src="lavender.jpg" width="200px">
  <p>Easy to grow shrub that flowers in late spring and summer. Is best planted in
    spring, in free-draining soil and thrives in full sun and is drought tolerant.</p>
</div>

<div>
  <h5><em>The Lilies</em></h5>
  <img src="lilly.jpg" width="200px">
  <p>Grown from bulbs, lilies are perennial flowers that will return year after year and
    require minimal care, provided that you plant them in the right place. Plant in the fall,
    a few weeks before the winter brings freezing temperatures, but ensure they are planted where
    there is lots of available sunlight, betweem 6-8hrs per day.</p>
</div>

<div>
  <h6><em>The Marigold</em></h6>
  <img src="marigold.jpg" width="200px">
  <p>Marigolds need a sunny position, as they flower poorly in shade. They need a
    well-drained soil that holds moisture during their summer flowering period.</p>
